## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eyego-dashboard.git
cd eyego-dashboard
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Firebase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

Make sure your Firebase project has **Email/Password Authentication** enabled.

## 💡 Implementation Approach

This project is built to demonstrate the following:

### 🧩 Modular Architecture
- Each feature is separated into slices (e.g., `userSlice`, `authSlice`) using Redux Toolkit.
- Reusable UI components built using **ShadCN UI** for consistency and rapid styling.

### 📋 Data Table
- User data is fetched from `https://randomuser.me/api` using an async Redux thunk.
- TanStack Table handles pagination, sorting, filtering, and row selection.
- Admin user (authenticated email) is excluded from the displayed user list.

### 🔐 Authentication
- Firebase Authentication is used for secure signup/login.
- The authenticated user's email is stored in Redux and used throughout the app.

### 📊 Charting
- `Recharts` displays a bar chart representing user age distribution.
